      <h1>SPECIAL THANKS & CREDIT</h1>
      <p>
        Vue Flow is, in it's core, a port of the <a href="https://reactflow.dev/">React Flow library</a>. Main utilities and
        concepts have stayed the same, though their use have changed through frameworks. Still, without the work of
        <a href="https://webkid.io/">Webkid</a> and their amazing developers, this would've been impossible to make with my
        limited time. Thus I thank them wholeheartedly for their work and hope this library can be of good use to a lot of people!
        Thank you for using and/or contributing to Vue Flow and thank's for reading.
